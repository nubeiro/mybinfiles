# My bin files

Utility scripts that live in my ~/bin. 


 - batcharge.py: See http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/my-extravagant-zsh-prompt/#my-right-prompt-battery-capacity. Just a small tweak to make it work with acpi output on Linux.
 - mkvhost: create a virtual host for current dir. It creates a new apache virtualhost, enables it and adds an entry on /etc/hosts for the new servername.
